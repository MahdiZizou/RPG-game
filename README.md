# RPG-game
In this code, a simple RPG game in python is developed. 
- The source of code is below and I learned it from "The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced!" course of Udemy:
### https://github.com/MuizZer07/The-Complete-Python-3-Course-Beginner-to-Advanced-Udemy-Course

- Note: replace game.py file in a seperate folder and rename the folder to "classes" so that the code and its external classes can work properly toghether.
